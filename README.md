## Anthony Young

A junior developer with a love and appreciation for agile, testing and best practices.

A Fitness Manager/Head Trainer in a previous life who has taken a huge leap of faith into the exciting world of tech.

Currently looking to launch my career within the tech industry that will help develop my current knowledge and allow me to

## Skills

#### Communication

My whole career has been working within hospitality in customer facing roles.  I’m experienced in talking with a wide range of clients from a variety of backgrounds ranging from entry level personnel to company CEO’s.  This is evidenced from being promoted to Fitness Manager within a year of employment at my previous job.

#### Problem Solving

This has always been a huge part of my life.  Starting the moment I stumbled upon a screwdriver and realised the things I could crack open with with it (tv, kitchen utilities, etc).  Finding out how these things worked by breaking and trying to repair them (TDD’s red, green, refactor cycle!), I believe ultimately led me down the path of coding.

#### Handling Pressure

I thrive under pressure.  Whether it be working to deadlines or dealing with complaints, pressure always seems to get the best out of me.  Makers has been extremely stressful, learning new technologies week to week, the sheer volume of overwhelming learning material and all this with a one year old son to look after.  Yet still I keep coming back for more and can’t wait to get my teeth into this industry.

#### Public Speaking  

Confident when presenting to large and small groups.  This skill was developed even further whilst at Makers when presenting final projects, conducting regular stand ups and weekly retro’s.
