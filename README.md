## Anthony Young

A junior developer with a love and appreciation for agile, testing and best practices.

A Fitness Manager/Head Trainer in a previous life who has taken a huge leap of faith into the exciting world of tech.

Currently looking to launch my career with a Junior Development role that will help build on my current knowledge and allow my drive and inquisitive nature to flourish.

## Skills

#### Communication

My whole career has been working within personal development in customer
facing roles. I’m experienced in communicating with people from all walks of life from Interns to CEOs all with a unique set of needs and requirements. Due to these strong skills, I was promoted from Head Trainer to Fitness Manager within a year of working for a chain of fitness establishments in London.

#### Problem Solving

I have a naturally inquisitive personality and find enjoyment in discovering why things work. Growing up I was always fiddling with broken TVs, bikes and household appliances trying to find a way to fix them. I believe this same curiosity is what drove me to become a developer.

#### Handling Pressure

 I thrive under pressure. Whether it be working to deadlines or dealing with complaints, I have produced some of my best work whilst under pressure. Makers Academy is a highly selective coding bootcamp and many of the other 27 people on my cohort found the fast pace and workload too much to handle however I found as the pressure increased, so did my drive to learn new technologies and experiment with hardware not included in the course such as beacons.

#### Public Speaking  

Confident when presenting to large and small groups. I built upon my corporate experience whilst at Makers by taking the lead during my team’s final project presentation, running regular stand ups and weekly retrospectives.
